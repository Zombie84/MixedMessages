MESSAGE GENERATOR
=================

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You’re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Plan your project
- Visualize your end result. What is it built with? What can it do? Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

**Endresult**: Get a simple random Message to integrate in a Site. Containig of 3 Words: A name, a verb and a another name.
The names end verbs are stored in an array and put together randomly.

## Come Up with a Topic
- Decide on what types of messages you want your program to output.

**Topic**: I decide: Violence :P

- Set up version control

Set up Git tracking in your directory and add and commit changes as you make them.

...

- Next Steps

You’re welcome to expand your program beyond these project tasks and get creative!

**Next step**: Simple html page-that shows message on every load.
